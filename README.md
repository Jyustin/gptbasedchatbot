inside contains many different files for a chatgpt based chatbot project

NOTE: this is mostly guidelines to help with building the project, not so much instructions. Do not expect this to work out of the box, some configuration will have to be done.

HOW TO USE:

1: create a new repository using this github template: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_portfolio

this is a java backend built on spring, and will be used for the endpoints for our project

2: open the new backend repository and place the chathistory folder into the following directory
YOURBackend\src\main\java\com\nighthawk\spring_portfolio\mvc

3: configure backend as needed

4: add cc-assistant.html, chatbot.css, chatbot.js, and the images to your prefered frontend repository of choice, configuring paths to match up with your project. any frontend should work, however this project was built on this one: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/Nighthawk-Pages

5: run both backend and frontend locally and test endpoints as well as frontend and backend connectivity
